# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Learn how to create a dynamic web app in rails. Integrate the ideas we have been learning in to one cohesive project. Have something we can show off.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Norm: Very collaborative, works better together, bouncing ideas off of each other, helping learn.
Nikki: Does well collaborating, can work alone sitting next to each other.
We both like both styles. Depends on the the problem or part of the project.
We will understand when someone is already on a train of thought and wait to discuss a problem or solution. "Just give me a minute"

We will debate. It's okay. We need to know why we're doing the things. Go back and review misunderstood or cloudy ideas.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Norm: Direct. Keep it straightforward. Overcommunicator.
Nikki: Undercommunicator. Just tell me.
Let each other know if there's an issue. No hurt feelings allowed.

* How would you describe your work style?
Norm: Slow and methodical. Don't like to do things twice. Do it the right way, no shortcuts. Rather turn in unfinished, but executed properly. Analysis Paralysis.
Nikki: samesies

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Norm: Good at logic. Come up with clever solutions to logic requirements. Good at finding fundamental ideas that help the overall project, that make the later steps easier. Math.
Nikki: Good at debugging. Good memory. Good with git/github.

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Norm: Conflicts ended up being productive. Partner was lying/keeping things/not producing.
Nikki: I am a good rubber duck. Not listened to.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Divide up general sections, one partner leads but we work together on the at section. Possibly by user stories, may edit based on project understanding.

* How will we overcome obstacles?
Straightforward. Asking for help as much as possible. Throw time at a problem.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Working in the room, stay in one spot. Take regular breaks (use be focused).

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Nikki: Wednesday nights (off-site).
Both off-site on Sundays. Will work afternoons together. May work remotely at night/morning.
Make sure we both have time to complete all the other tasks for class time.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Norm: Working on being more kind. Says things factually.
Nikki: Kind and thoughtful. Need to work on being more straightfoward.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Norm: Improve memory of lessons. Syntax.
Nikki: Improve on taking a big problem and making it into small approachable problems.
See above for strengths.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Wunderlist for collab. Nikki: Waffle, to practice. Slack. Talk via phone/slack.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Ask questions. Always working on branches and partner merges features. Clear naming for unsure code.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Successful if we have learned a lot. Feel confident setting up a rails project from scratch. Look forward towards working together again. Improved CSS and HTML skills.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
High fives. Notes on commits/merges. Slack notes.
